# The God Variable — Manuscript

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the exploratory manuscript:

**“The God Variable: A Constraint-Based Exploration of Long-Horizon Survivability”**

The manuscript investigates whether long-term system survivability and resistance to irreversible degradation can be meaningfully modeled using constraint-based scalar measures.

This work is exploratory and research-oriented. It does not claim a completed physical theory or validated universal law.

  The main LaTeX manuscript. This file contains the full paper, including abstract, conceptual framework, toy model discussion, limitations, and conclusions.

Figures, references, and supporting material may be added here as the manuscript evolves.

## Scientific Scope

The manuscript explores survivability as a **constrained property**, not as an optimization objective. It focuses on:

- Long-horizon system behavior
- Irreversibility and loss of recovery paths
- The limits of scalar representations for survivability
- Falsifiability through simplified toy models

The work is intentionally conservative in its claims. Negative or ambiguous results are treated as informative rather than disqualifying.

## Relationship to Simulations

The simulations located in the top-level `simulations/` directory serve as conceptual probes referenced by the manuscript. They are intentionally simplified and are not intended to model real-world systems directly.

The manuscript and simulations should be read together.
