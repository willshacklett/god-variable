# The God Variable

This repository accompanies an **exploratory research manuscript** investigating whether long-term system survivability and irreversibility avoidance can be modeled using constraint-based scalar measures.

The work is speculative but structured, combining conceptual framing with toy models and simulations intended to test internal consistency and extensibility.

This repository does **not** claim a complete physical theory.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to support an academic-style manuscript by providing:

- Constraint-based toy models
- Simple simulations exploring survivability dynamics
- Reproducible examples used in the paper
- A clear separation between hypothesis, model, and claim

The goal is **exploration**, not assertion.

## The God Variable (Conceptual Overview)

The *God Variable* (GV) is introduced as a proposed scalar quantity representing a system’s:

- Ability to survive over long horizons
- Capacity for self-correction
- Exposure to irreversible state degradation

Conceptually, GV is inspired by ideas from:
- Systems theory
- Irreversibility and entropy
- Constraint-based optimization
- Long-horizon stability analysis

GV is **not assumed to be fundamental**, conserved, or universal.  
It is treated as a *candidate constraint measure* whose usefulness must be demonstrated empirically.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

### This **is**:
- A constraint-based hypothesis
- A testable modeling framework
- A research-oriented exploration
- A companion to executable toy simulations

### This **is not**:
- A claim of a “Theory of Everything”
- A religious or metaphysical assertion
- A completed physical law
- A validated universal constant

All claims are intentionally scoped and provisional.
