# Simulations

This directory contains toy simulations used in the accompanying manuscript:

**“The God Variable: A Constraint-Based Exploration of Long-Horizon Survivability.”**

These models are intentionally simplified and are designed for conceptual exploration rather than empirical validation.

## Contents

### `langevin.py`
Implements a stochastic dynamical system inspired by Langevin dynamics.

Used in the manuscript to examine:
- Sensitivity of the God Variable (GV) to noise and perturbations
- Gradual erosion of recovery capacity
- Long-horizon survivability under stochastic evolution

Referenced in:  
**Section 3.1 — Stochastic Survivability Model**

### `frw.py`
Implements a cosmology-inspired toy evolution model.

Used in the manuscript to explore:
- Constraint-driven evolution
- Irreversible trajectories under monotonic dynamics
- Conceptual limits of scalar survivability measures

Referenced in:  
**Section 3.2 — Cosmology-Inspired Constraint Model**

## Scope

These simulations are not intended to model physical reality directly.  
They exist to probe the strengths and limitations of scalar survivability constraints under controlled conditions.

Negative or ambiguous results are considered informative.
